# geoguess_irl

Play geoguessr-like game but irl!
Randomly generate location in radius, and walk to location using gps to see how close your guess is.

This is the flutter ui for the app.

The server repo is located at <https://github.com/superj6/geoguess-irl-server>

To build in release mode seems u need to replace "mapsApiKey" with actual value instead of .env placeholder, idk why.
